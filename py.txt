What is Python?
Python is a cross-platform programming language, meaning, it runs on multiple platforms like Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Unix and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines.
 It is free and open source.

Even though most of todayâ€™s Linux and Mac have Python preinstalled in it, the version might be out-of-date.
 So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version. You can download the latest version of Python and install it.
